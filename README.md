# TODO
[ x ] Create queries to the dining hall website

[ x ] Get the food names for the day

[ x ] Create queries to the nutrition website
        [ ] Make a page for and implement the nutrition info 

[ ] Match the food names to the nutrition

[ ] Decide on how much (and which) user info we want to ask for (e.g. height, age, weight)
    [ ] Match up food  to target calculated daily caloric intake (has to be the same dining hall though)
    [ ] Create more specifics: nutrient breakdown needed - how much protein, how much carbs, how much fruits? 
[ ] Since we already put the rewards page: decide on how we'd reward users. 
 
[ ] Opt: Create a vegan option (display and run program only for foods labeled vegan/vegetarian)


[ ] Make it look nice. 
[ ] The presentation.
